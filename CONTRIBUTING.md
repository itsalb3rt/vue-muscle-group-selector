## How to contribute

There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

### Getting Started

- Fork the repository

### Submitting Changes

- Push your changes to your fork
- Submit a pull request

### Additional Resources

The idea is that the code is as readable as possible for everyone, not just for those who come from quasar.

You can check the quasar cofiguration guide [here](https://quasar.dev/start/vs-code-configuration#introduction).
